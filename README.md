## Inter-app communication

The Gnokey Mobile app uses `expo-linking` to exchange data with your app such as dSocial.
This way, your app can sign in or sign a transaction using the Gnokey Mobile app.

### Sign in

Example of a dSocial request for sign in:
```
land.gno.gnokey://tosignin?callback=tech.berty.dsocial%3A%2F%2Fsignin-callback
```
- Base URL: `land.gno.gnokey://tosignin`
- Parameters:
  - callback: the URL that Gnokey Mobile will call after the user selects the account.

Example response:
```
tech.berty.dsocial://signin-callback?address=g19h0el2p7z8thtqy4rze0n6en94xux9fazf0rp3&cachekill=1732030818190
```
- Base URL: The `callback` from the request. In this case, `tech.berty.dsocial://signin-callback`
- Parameters:
  - address: the address of the selected user
  - cachekill: For testing. Ignore this.

### Sign a transaction
Example of a dSocial request to Gnokey Mobile to sign a transaction (with added newlines for clarity):

### Testing on iOS simulator

If you are using `make ios` to run Gnokey Mobile in the iOS simulator, you can send a test transaction simply by
pasting the request URL into Safari in the simulator. This will open Gnokey Mobile where you can approve. The
response URL is printed in the terminal running `make ios` .

### Testing on Android simulator

If you are using `make android` to run Gnokey Mobile in the Android simulator, you can use `adb` to send the URL
of a test transaction. You must change each `&` to `\&` . The following example will open Gnokey Mobile where you can approve. The
response URL is printed in the terminal running `make android` .
```
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "land.gno.gnokey://tosign?tx=%7B%22msg%22%3A%5B%7B%22%40type%22%3A%22%2Fvm.m_call%22%2C%22caller%22%3A%22g19h0el2p7z8thtqy4rze0n6en94xux9fazf0rp3%22%2C%22send%22%3A%22%22%2C%22pkg_path%22%3A%22gno.land%2Fr%2Fberty%2Fsocial%22%2C%22func%22%3A%22PostMessage%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22Hello%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22fee%22%3A%7B%22gas_wanted%22%3A%2210000000%22%2C%22gas_fee%22%3A%221000000ugnot%22%7D%2C%22signatures%22%3Anull%2C%22memo%22%3A%22%22%7D\&address=g19h0el2p7z8thtqy4rze0n6en94xux9fazf0rp3\&client_name=dSocial\&reason=Post%20a%20message\&callback=tech.berty.dsocial%3A%2F%2Fpost"
