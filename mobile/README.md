## ðŸš€ How to use

### Build for iOS

#### Install the tools with asdf (only need to do once)

```sh
make asdf.install_tools
```

If you get an error like "https://github.com/CocoaPods/CLAide.git (at master@97b765e) is not yet checked out" then reinstall cocoapods like this:

```sh
asdf uninstall cocoapods
make asdf.install_tools
```

```sh
# to build and run on ios:
make ios
```

### Build for Android

#### Install the tools with asdf (only need to do once)

(If not building for iOS, edit the file `.tool-versions` and remove the unneeded lines for `ruby` and `cocoapods`.)

```sh
make asdf.install_tools
```

#### Set up the Android NDK

- Launch Android Studio and accept the default startup options. Create a new
  default project (so that we get the main screen).
- On the Tools menu, open the SDK Manager.
- In the "SDK Tools" tab, click "Show Package Details". Expand
  "NDK (Side by side)" and check "23.1.7779620".
- Click OK to install and close the SDK Manager.

```sh
# to build and run on android:
make android

# to start Metro Bundler:
make start
```
